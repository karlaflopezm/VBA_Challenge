Multiple-Year-Stock-Data


**Instructions**

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol

- Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

- The total stock volume of the stock.

- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
